# InferringBacterialDynamics
We use symbolic regression to infer the growth dynamics of a monoculture plate of bacterial colonies.

We use synthetic datasets representing different dynamical systems and pySR as our symbolic regression engine. 
The datasets are: Autocorrelated Carrying Capacity (ACK), Variable Initial Population (ACN), Autocorrelated Initial Nutrient Concentration (ACS) and Diffusion (DIFF). Data is not provided here.

Done as my Master's in Data Science thesis, within Bioinformatics and Evolution Group at University of Helsinki. Thesis will be posted later.
